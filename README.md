# Simple Staking Smart Contract

## Description of the Project

The Simple Staking Smart Contract is a decentralized application built on the Aptos blockchain that allows users to stake their AptosCoin tokens in a secure and transparent manner. This contract provides two core functionalities: staking tokens to earn rewards over time and unstaking tokens when users want to withdraw their assets.

The contract maintains individual staking positions for each user, tracking both the amount of tokens staked and the timestamp of when the staking began. This foundational system creates the infrastructure for a reward-based staking mechanism while ensuring users maintain full control over their staked assets.

Built using Move programming language, the contract leverages Aptos's resource-oriented programming model to ensure memory safety and prevent common smart contract vulnerabilities like reentrancy attacks and resource duplication.

## Vision of the Project

Our vision is to democratize DeFi staking by providing a simple, secure, and accessible staking platform on the Aptos blockchain. We aim to:

- **Empower Individual Users**: Enable anyone to participate in staking without complex technical knowledge or minimum investment barriers
- **Promote Financial Inclusion**: Create opportunities for users worldwide to earn passive income through cryptocurrency staking
- **Build Trust Through Transparency**: Leverage blockchain technology to ensure all staking activities are transparent and verifiable
- **Foster Aptos Ecosystem Growth**: Contribute to the growth and adoption of the Aptos blockchain by providing essential DeFi infrastructure

We believe that staking should be straightforward, secure, and rewarding for all participants, regardless of their technical expertise or investment size.

## Future Scope of the Project
